**This application was not built with the intention of doing harm. It was rather thinked as a proof of concept.**

###What it does
This .NET application simulates the infection of a Trojan via CMD (virus/bin/Debug/virus.bat) and, after a while, displays a fake BSoD.
The concept was to disable almost completely an eventual user response to this fake blue screen, so both keyboard and pointer (mouse) are disabled.

*To gain keyboard and mouse control back, you must use CTRL-ALT-DEL, and then close the BSoD window with Alt-F4*

###How to use

1. Download and open the .sln file in Visual Studio*
2. Execute virus/bin/Debug/virus.exe
3. Follow instructions stated in upper paragraph to regain control of your system
