# BSoD.NET
Small VB.NET application simulating a virus attack and a BSoD

**This application was not built with the intention of doing harm. It was rather thinked as a proof of concept.**

###What it does
This .NET application simulates the infection of a Trojan via CMD (virus/bin/Debug/virus.bat) and, after a while, displays a fake BSoD.
The concept was to disable almost completely an eventual user response to this fake blue screen, so both keyboard and pointer (mouse) are disabled.

*To gain keyboard and mouse control back, you must use CTRL-ALT-DEL, and then close the BSoD window with Alt-F4*

###How to use

1) Execute virus/bin/Debug/virus.exe
2) Follow instructions stated in upper paragraph to regain control of your system

#We guarantee no harm is done to your computer. If you doubt, you can always open the project in Visual Studio* and recompile
